#### Blue Pan Caters
###### Project Overview

The project is the design and development of a professional website for Blue Pan Bakers and Caterers, a business that specializes in baking, catering services, and event décor. The purpose of the website is to establish an online presence that showcases the company’s products and services, attracts potential customers, and improves customer engagement.



The website will provide information about the bakery and catering offerings, display product galleries (cakes, platters, and décor), and allow customers to make inquiries or place orders easily. It will also highlight the company’s brand identity, mission, and vision, positioning Blue Pan Bakers and Caterers as a reliable and creative service provider.



By the end of the project, Blue Pan Bakers and Caterers will have a fully functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing website that enhances marketing efforts, increases visibility, and supports business growth.

###### Website Goals and Objectives
The goals that I have for this website would be for my aunt to have increased clientele and sell her products and services. To increase recognition and engagement provide customers with needed information, rather than customers seeking for answers from the owner when they can just find what they are looking for on the website. Create a strong online presence that communicates the bakery’s identity, values, and unique selling points this will enhance brand visibility. To increase customer engagement, we’ll provide a user-friendly and interactive platform that allows customers to connect with the brand beyond in-store visits. Attract new customers beyond the bakery’s physical location, including event catering clients this ties in with increasing clientele. To improve service efficiency, use the website as a tool to streamline orders, bookings, and customer inquiries. Leverage digital marketing opportunities to boost sales and grow the customer base. The objectives would be uploading and maintain a digital menu with clear descriptions, prices, and high-quality images of bakery items and catering packages. Adding a booking form with a date, event details, and specifications on the catering/baked goods. Optimize the site for smartphones and tablets to improve accessibility and customer convenience. Link the website to Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, while using SEO and Google Analytics to drive traffic and track performance. A live chat, chatbot, or easy-to-find contact form for quick responses to inquiries and complaints.

###### Features and functionality
I am proposing the following features for the website an about us page, contact us page and homepage the product and services page will be part of the functionality of the website where users will be able to scroll through the images similarly to how one does on the phone in the gallery/photos app the website will have videos as well. Images and videos of the bakers at work how the setting up of the platters go the decorating of the cake etc. The final functionality would be a search bar. .  For the home page we’ll have navigation logo and slogan. For the about us page we’ll have navigation background/description of business and picture of founder who is also the baker and manager. For the product and services page we’ll have navigation the products offered, their prices and images, we’ll have the service offered and images of that. The gallery page will have all images of our products and services.
